#   - Comments begin with the '#' character
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#   - Top level entries are assumed to be groups, start with 'all' to have a full hierchy
#   - Hosts must be specified in a group's hosts:
#     and they must be a key (: terminated)
#   - groups can have children, hosts and vars keys
#   - You can enter hostnames or ip addresses
#   - A hostname/ip can be a member of multiple groups

# ATTENTION!
# When you define variables in hosts.yml, every component which you define will overwrite original generated value from {{ router_vars }} file!
# Here defined connector/connectors will erase generated connector/connectors!!!
# This issue is in progress of solving :)


# In case of add new variables for any host, you have to adhere the convention
# of variable syntax (see bellow):

# all:
#   hosts:
#     alain:
#       # Variables for host 'alain'
#       variables:
#         # machine field is required
#         machine: alain
#         router:
#         - id: alain
#           mode: standalone
#         connector:
#         - host: 6.6.6.6
#           port: 4567

# It's possible to add more options (listener, linkRoute, sslprofile....)
